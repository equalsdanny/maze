# Maze Project

A 3D browser game featuring a randomly generated maze.

The goal is to find a cube with my photo in the other corner of the maze.

## Technologies

The dynamic part of the web-application is a Servlet serving
the randomly generated maze data and some other metadata.

The static part contains framing HTML files and the core JavaScript where all the magic happens.
Rendering is done via WebGL.
